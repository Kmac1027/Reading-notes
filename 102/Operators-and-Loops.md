# Operators and Loops

## Duckett: JavaScript & jQuery

### Comparison Operators: Evaluating conditions

- you can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be. the result will be a **Boolean**: *True* or *False*
- example 

```
== is equal to
!= is not equal to
=== is strict equal to
!== strict not equal to
> greater than
< less than
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to
```

### Logical Operators

- while **comparison operators** return *single* values of true or false, **Logical Operators** allow you to compare the results of more than one camparison operator
- example
```
&& logical *AND* (this operator tests more than one condition)
|| logical *OR* (this operator tests at least one condition)
! logical *NOT* (this operator takes a single **Boolean** value and inverts it)
```

### Loops

- loops check a condition, if the return is *true*, a code block will run. the condition is then checked again and if it still returns *true*, the cocde block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns *false*
- 3 common types of loops
    1. FOR (for running a code a specific amount of time)
    1. WHILE (will continue to run while the condition is *true*)
    1. DO WHILE (similar to *WHILE* but will always run the statment inside the curley braces at least once, even if the condition is *false*)

### Loop Counters

- a *FOR* loop uses a counter as a condition. This instructs the code to run a specified number of times<br>
