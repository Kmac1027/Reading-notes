# Computer Architecture and Logic

## how do computers work

- input, storage, process, output
- binary & data - elecricity through one wire is either on or off, representing 1 or 0, true or false, yes or no, or anything else with only 2 options, this is called a bit, more than one wire becomes multiple bits
- all things can be represented with numbers
- a circut can change a signal from on to off or off to on
- there are different kind of circuts that work in different ways
- putting all these circuts together can accomplish anything
 - the smaller the circuts the faster electricity can go cuz it litterally has less space it has to travel
 - OS (operating system) is the master program that manages how the software uses the hardware of a computer
