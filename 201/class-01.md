## Ducket HTML and CSS

### HTML Introduction

- HTML - structure
- CSS - Presentation and Layout
- People can access the web through Broqwsers, Webservers, Screen readers

### HTML Chapter 1 "Structer"

- Structer similar to newspaper or word doc
- uses *ELEMENTS* to describe the structure of pages
```
Attribute Name = "Attribute Value"
```
- HTML pages are text documents
- HTML uses tags
- tagsw are often refered to as elements
- tags usually have an open and close tag but not always

- Example

```
<p> blah blah blah </p> <br>
<p> blah blah blah </p>
the <p> tag needs a closing tag but the <br> tag does not
```

- open tags can have atributes which require a name and a value

### HTML chapter 8 "Extra Markup"

- Doctype always comes first, tells the browser which version of HTML is being used
```
<!DOCTYPE>
```
- comments
```
<!-- Comment goes here -->
```
- every HTML element can carry the id attribute
- no two elements on a page can have the same id attribute
- every HTML element can carry a class attribute
- Class attributes can share the same value
- block elements create a new line
- inline elements stay in the same line
- an iframe (short for inline frame) is like a little window in your page that shows another page, <br>
like when a site shows a google map

```
<iframe src=" " height=" " width=" "></iframe>
```

- div and span allow you to group block 
level and inline elements together

```
<div>
<span>
```

- meta tag allows you to add info about your page, must be within the head tag
