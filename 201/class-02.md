# Read: 02 - HTML Text, CSS Introduction, and Basic JavaScript Instructions

## Duckett HTML

### Chapter 2: Text

- structural markup - the elements that you can use to describe both headlines and paragraphs

```
example
<h1>
<p>
<b>
<i>
<sup>
<sub>
<br />
<hr />
```

- semantic markup - provides extra information, such as 
  1. where an emphasis is placed in a sentence
  1. that something written is a quotation
  1. the meaning of acronyms
  1. ...and so on

```
example
<strong>
<em>
<blockquote>
<abbr>
<cite>
```

### Chapter 10: Introducing CSS

 - you can think of CSS as working with imaginary boxes - think of each element tag in an html document as in its own box
 - CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box, and the content of that box, is presented
 - selector cheat sheet - https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp
 - CSS rules cascade, meaning the last rule takes precidence, or the one furthest down on the page
 - also, the more specific a rule the more precident it is given
 - Rules are amde up of selectors and declarations
 - different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements
 - declarations are made up of 2 parts
  1. the properties of the element that you want to change
  1. and the value of those properties
- although CSS may apeear in the same document as HTML, it is best to have it in its own document i.e. seperation of concerns

## Ducket Javascript

### Chapter 2: Basic Javascript instructions

- statement: Each individual step of a script is called a **STATEMENT**
- each statement starts on a new line
- leave god comments to explain what your code is doing
- Variables is how we store information in Javascript
- Data types
  1. string
  1. Numeric
  1. Boolean (true or false)
- an **Array** is a type of variable but it doesnt just store one value ,it stores a list of values
- an expression results in a single value, broadly speaking there are two types of expressions
  1. expressions that just assign a value to a variable
  1. expressions that use two or more values to return a single value
- expressions rely on **operators** to calculate a value

### Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops, continued in class 03 notes

- condition statements allow your code to make desicions about what to do next
- comparison operators are used to compare two operands
- logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of compqrison operators
- if/else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true and another is false
- switch statments allows you to compare a value against possible outcomes, and can provide a default option if none match
