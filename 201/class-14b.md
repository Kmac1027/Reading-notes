## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

### THE WORK ISSUE: REIMAGINING THE OFFICE

- the time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities has ballooned by 50 percent or more
- Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction
- In 2012, the company embarked on an initiative — code-named Project Aristotle
- No matter how researchers arranged the data, though, it was almost impossible to find patterns — or any evidence that the composition of a team made any difference
- two teams might have nearly identical makeups, with overlapping memberships, but radically different levels of effectiveness
- group norms - Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather
- Team members may behave in certain ways as individuals — they may chafe against authority or prefer working independently — but when they gather, the group’s norms typically override individual proclivities and encourage deference to the team.
- After looking at over a hundred groups for more than a year, Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving
- what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. The right norms, in other words, could raise a group’s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright.
- the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues
-  if you are given a choice between the serious-minded Team A or the free-flowing Team B, you should probably opt for Team B.
- **THIS _---------> In contrast, on Team B, people may speak over one another, go on tangents and socialize instead of remaining focused on the agenda. The team may seem inefficient to a casual observer. But all the team members speak as much as they need to. They are sensitive to one another’s moods and share personal stories and emotions. While Team B might not contain as many individual stars, the sum will be greater than its parts.**
- as aspects of what’s known as psychological safety — a group culture that the Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson defines as a ‘‘shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.’’ 
- ’ Edmondson wrote in a study published in 1999. ‘‘It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.’’
- **Google’s data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work.**
- opening up a group to more personal info of eachother can help people feel safer with one another adn feel more connected.
- psychological safety and emotional conversations are related
- no one wants to put on a ‘‘work face’’ when they get to the office. No one wants to leave part of their personality and inner life at home.
- By putting things like empathy and sensitivity into charts and data reports, it makes them easier to talk about,’’ Sakaguchi told me. ‘‘It’s easier to talk about our feelings when we can point to a number.
