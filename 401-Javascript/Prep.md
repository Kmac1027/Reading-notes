## Solving Problems

### common Mistakes

-  improper allocation of time
- dont start writting code as soon as possible - make sure you take enough time to understand the problem completely before attempting to solve it.
- Keep it Simple

### A simple set of steps

1. Read the problem completely twice.
1. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
1. Optimize the manual steps.
1. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
1. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
1. Optimize the real code.

- As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3.

## Act like you make $1000/hr

- what if you placed a high value on your time?
- Being busy is a form of mental lazines, It takes discipline to not become “busy.”
- The most successful people I know are not busy. They’re focused
- **I AM IN CHARGE OF MY TIME, NO ONE ELSE**
- For world-class performers, busyness and stress are the enemy. They’re a sign you’re off-track. It means you’ve been lazy and undisciplined, and have let too many unimportant tasks take you away from what really matters.
- Busyness and exhaustion should be your enemy. If you’re chronically stressed and up late working, you’re doing something wrong. Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. Then when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of your day.
- Say No more, dont let others dictate the value of your time

## How to think like a programmer

- Problem solving is the meta-skill.
- The best way involves two things
  a) having a framework
  b) practicing it.
- “The biggest mistake I see new programmers make is focusing on learning syntax instead of learning how to solve problems.” — V. Anton Spraul

### Understand

- Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them
- How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.

### Plan

- Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!

### Divide

- Do not try to solve one big problem
- Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.
- Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer).
- After that, simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn’t depend on others being solved.
- Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.
- Connecting all your “sub-solutions” will give you the solution to the original problem. Congratulations!
- This technique is a cornerstone of problem-solving. Remember it (read this step again, if you must).

### Stuck/Debugging

- Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).
- Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
- Research: Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions).

### Practace

## The 5 Whys

- Like toyota, go to the shop floor to actually see whats going on, dont just make desicions or solve problems based on what you think is happening

1. **Assemble a Team** - Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix. Include someone to act as a facilitator , who can keep the team focused on identifying effective counter-measures.

1. **Define the Problem** - If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on. For example, "Team A isn't meeting its response time targets" or "Software release B resulted in too many rollback failures." Then, write your statement on a whiteboard or sticky note, leaving enough space around it to add your answers to the repeated question, "Why?"

1. **Ask the First "Why?"** - Ask your team why the problem is occurring. (For example, "Why isn't Team A meeting its response time targets?") Asking "Why?" sounds simple, but answering it requires serious thought. Search for answers that are grounded in fact: they must be accounts of things that have actually happened, not guesses at what might have happened.
This prevents 5 Whys from becoming just a process of deductive reasoning, which can generate a large number of possible causes and, sometimes, create more confusion as you chase down hypothetical problems. Your team members may come up with one obvious reason why, or several plausible ones. Record their answers as succinct phrases, rather than as single words or lengthy statements, and write them below (or beside) your problem statement. For example, saying "volume of calls is too high" is better than a vague "overloaded."

1. **Ask "Why?" Four More Times** - For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further "whys" in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded.
