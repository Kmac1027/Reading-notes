#  Programming with JavaScript

## Duckett: JavaScript & jQuery

- Javascript usually interacts  
    1. Access
    1. modify
    1. Program
    1. React
 - a script is a set of instructions a computer follows to achieve a goal, much like a recipe 
 - when writting a script
    1. state your goal
    1. list the tasks that need to be completed to achieve that goal
 - what is the big picture of what you want to achieve
    1. define the goal
    1. design the scrpt
    1. code each step

## Expressions

- an expression results in a single value. broadly speaking there are two types of expressions
    1. expressions that assign a value to a variable
    1. expressions that use two or more values to return a single value
- expressions rely on operators

## Operators

- operators create a single value from one or more values
- example of arithmetic operators

```

+ Addition
- Subtraction
* Multiplication
/ Division
% Modulus (division remainde)
++ Increment
-- Decrement
```

- string operator: there is only one. the + symbol. it joins the strings on either side of it

## Function

- functions let you group a series of statements together to preform a specific task
- if different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function, rather then repeating the same set of statements
